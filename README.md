## 📖 Overview

The **Academic Omni-Tutor** is a lightweight, zero-dependency web application designed to help students master complex academic subjects. It consolidates three distinct learning modules—**Multivariate Analysis**, **Economics**, and **Non-Parametric Statistics**—into a single, cohesive interface.

The app features a dual-mode assessment system (Objective Quiz & Subjective Case Studies) and integrates with **Google's Gemini API** to provide real-time, context-aware AI tutoring.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🌐 Unified Dashboard
* **Three Disciplines, One App:** seamlessly switch between Multivariate Stats, Economics, and Non-Parametric modules without reloading the page.
* **Global Navigation:** Intuitive UI allows for easy transitioning between the main menu and specific learning modules.

### 2. 🧠 AI-Powered Explanations
* **Dynamic Personas:** The AI adapts its teaching style based on the active module (e.g., acting as an Economics Professor vs. a Statistics Professor).
* **Smart Feedback:** Get instant, detailed explanations for quiz answers and subjective case studies using the Gemini API.

### 3. 📊 Assessment Modes
* **Objective Quizzes:** Multiple-choice questions with instant validation and logic explanations.
* **Subjective Case Studies:** Deep-dive scenarios (e.g., PCA proofs, Market Shifts) with "Reveal Solution" functionality and AI elaboration.

### 4. 🖼️ Contextual Visual Learning
* **Diagram Triggers:** The system intelligently identifies complex concepts (like *Scree Plots*, *Supply/Demand Shifts*, or *Skewed Distributions*) and prompts the user to visualize them.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML5, JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN for zero-build setup).
* **Markdown Rendering:** Marked.js.
* **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API (v1beta).
* **Math Rendering:** Custom LaTeX parsing logic (via MathJax or simple regex).
